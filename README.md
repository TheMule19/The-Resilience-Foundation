# The-Resilience-Foundation
All things about The Resilience Foundation
The Resilience Foundation is based in Norwich, Norfolk.UK. It takes as its starting point the work carried out by The Resilience Centre at Stockholm University, Sweden. It will then seek to apply those ideas and knowledge to its local setting. Begun in 2018 it seeks show how resilience theory can be applied in its own behaviour as well the work that it supports by others. To that end its time frame is in the long term, 50-100 years rather than the short term, 3-5 yrs. If you would like to support our work then please get in touch at resiliencfoundation@myphone.coop 
We would love to hear from you with your ideas
Thanks for your time.
